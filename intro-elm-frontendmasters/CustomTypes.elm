-- Custom types create a brand new types that didn't exist before.
-- Type alias are just giving a name for exisitng types. Compound types = type aliases

-- Capital letters are reserved for types and type annotations and custom types.
-- also konwn in other languages as "sum types" "union types" "ADTs"
-- type Tab ist a custom type and YourFeed | GlobalFeed | TagFeed are variants

-- The example of a container is TagFeed String -> we are putting the String into the TagFeed container

-- We can use pattern matching to get the value out of the container
-- In case of expression you need to cover all types, that's why you will never get null --> you need to return something e.g. Nothing
-- In Elm you always return something back, in if the same if is basically an expression like ternary in js true ? true : false
-- That's why you have also a catch all clause _ -> ...
